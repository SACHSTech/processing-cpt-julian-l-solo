# CATQUEST

Welcome to Catquest, where computer science lore meets fun!

In this shoot 'em up game you will control BOTH of the brave protagonists, Meowtrix and Catdrone. They love discovering secret languages, though it seems like this time they'll need to fight for their lives to get the knowledge of a special language.

You can go through the menu, look at the cutscene, and try out the bosses. If you feel like they're too easy, up the difficulty in the settings each time you reset, you'll find them much harder.

**Warning**: This game has a fair amount of limitations, including the lack of backgrounds to prevent lag, the lack of animation since it'd add way too many pictures, and the potential possibility of frame lags causing wrong hitboxes and timings; the frame count lagging may cause the game to lag as well.
