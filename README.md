# CATQUEST

Welcome to Catquest, where computer science lore meets fun!

In this shoot 'em up game you will control BOTH of the brave protagonists, Meowtrix and Catdrone. They love discovering secret languages, though it seems like this time they'll need to fight for their lives to get the knowledge of a special language. For each boss, avoid their projectiles and get their health to zero using the drone. Boss health is hidden to add an element of mystery and suspense, so be careful of your actions.

You can go through the menu, look at the cutscene, and try out the bosses. If you feel like they're too easy, up the difficulty in the settings __each time you reset__, you'll find them much harder.

The interactivity is doubled based on the fact that you control two characters! Meowtrix uses WASD, whereas Catdrone uses arrow keys. Catdrone will be your attacker, helping you defeat the languages. Meowtrix is simply there to save the day and to try not to perish from the rogue coding languages.

If you like coding-themed games, want to explore Meowtrix's adventure, and dodge a lot of bullets, this game is for you.

**Warning**: This game has a fair amount of limitations, including the lack of backgrounds to prevent lag, the lack of animation since it'd add way too many pictures, and the potential possibility of frame lags causing wrong hitboxes and timings; the frame count lagging may cause the game to lag as well.

The first two bosses (C Sharp++ and Swift) are relatively simplistic, but are made as practice bosses. Go will up the difficulty a little.
